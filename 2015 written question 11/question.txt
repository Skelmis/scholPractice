As part of a game, you want the user to enter a number between 1 and 9. Write a
fragment of code that prompts the user to enter a number, reads the value they entered,
and checks to see if it is in the range 1 to 9. If the number is not in the required range
you should display an error message and ask the user to try again. If they enter an invalid
number 10 times, your program should just give them the value 5.
