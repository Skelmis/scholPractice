Time (Careful and Accurate Programming)
Your programming work in this question will be assessed on two criteria:
(a) Completeness and accuracy of the program.
(b) Good presentation. That is, it should make good use of programming language facilities,
be well organised, neatly laid out, and lightly commented.

Software often has to deal with time values – reading, writing and doing calculations may
all be required. Consequently, most programming languages have libraries of functions to
manage times (eg: time.h accesses time functions in C). Your task for this question is to
write a program with your own time handling.
Your program must read a ‘start’ time and a ‘finish’ time (in hours, minutes and seconds)
from the keyboard, then report the difference (in hours, minutes and seconds). If for
example, the inputs were a runner’s start and finish times for a marathon, your program
would be able to tell them how long they took. Your program must read integers,
characters and/or strings from input and must not use any time facilities from your
programming language or libraries.
A sample run of a version of the program might have input and output like this (note that
data input by the person running the program is underlined):
Enter start time: 10:45.37
Enter finish time: 12:33.10
Time taken was 1:47.33
Enter start time: 12:33.24
Enter finish time: 12.27.12
You finished before you began
The format used for inputting and outputting times is up to you. Think about how you will
tell the user what format to use. Think about other issues that might arise and how you
will deal with incorrect input, if that can happen.
